DYNO is an advanced, decentralized and secure digital currency.
Based on Dash, it's an enhanced and further developed version, featuring the masternode technology,
near-instant and secure payments as well as anonymous transactions.
With a fast block time of only 2 minutes, transactions will usually confirm and be successfully
processed very quickly. DYNO's blockchain uses the advanced NeoScrypt Proof-of-Work algorithm to
